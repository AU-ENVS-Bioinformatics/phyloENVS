Description: This package provides tailored tools for visualizing and analyzing microbial 
  community data, with a focus on rRNA and mRNA datasets from environmental 
  samples such as soil, ice, and other ecosystems. Built to enhance the 
  functionality of the 'phyloseq' package, it offers customizable and
